          Building websites from wireframes that I had received. Some of those
          questions were:

        <p tw="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-500 leading-loose">
          These types of questions led me to miss numerous deadlines, and I
          wasted time and energy in back-and-forth communication. Sadly, this
          situation could have been avoided if the wireframes had provided
          enough detail.

          Now that I am a UX designer, I notice that some designers tend to
          forget that wireframes are equally creative and technical. We are
          responsible for designing great ideas, but we are also responsible for
          creating product specifications. I admit that there can be so many
          details to remember that itâ€™s easy to lose track. To save time and
          energy for myself, I gathered all of my years of wireframing knowledge
          into a single checklist that I refer to throughout the process. And
          now I am sharing this knowledge with you, so that you can get back to
          being creative.
